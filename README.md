- Understand purchasing behavior
- Help businesses target customers effectively

##  Machine Learning Techniques
- Unsupervised Learning
- K-Means Clustering
- Data Scaling
- Elbow Method (Optimal Cluster Selection)

##  Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
- 
##  Project Workflow
1. Data Loading
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Feature Scaling
4. Optimal Cluster Selection (Elbow Method)
5. K-Means Clustering
6. Customer Profiling

##  Results
Customers are segmented into multiple groups such as:
- High income high spending
- Budget customers
